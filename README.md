This repository presents a structured pathway for learning and applying machine learning and deep learning techniques in drug discovery. It combines theoretical resources, hands-on implementations, and small research-style projects focused on virtual screening, molecular representation, and predictive modeling of small molecules.

In addition to practical projects, the repository introduces the fundamental toolkit for machine learning in Python, covering libraries essential for data processing, model development, and cheminformatics. It also includes recommended courses, books, and selected research materials that support understanding and mastering machine learning approaches for drug design, together with tutorials and workflows illustrating applications such as virtual screening and docking.
