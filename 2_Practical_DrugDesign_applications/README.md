In this section, *Practical Drug Design Applications*, I present a collection of hands-on projects focused on applying machine learning and deep learning methods to problems in drug discovery. These projects are part of the main objective of this repository, which is to develop practical skills in building predictive models and performing virtual screening using molecular data.

The projects in this section cover several topics, including:
- Predictive modeling for drug design  
- Machine learning workflows for molecular datasets  
- Handling and processing common chemical file formats  
- Machine learning approaches for virtual screening  
- Deep learning models for virtual screening  

Most of the materials are provided in Jupyter Notebook format, allowing easy experimentation, modification, and reuse. The notebooks are intended to serve both as learning resources and as practical examples for researchers or students interested in machine learning applications in drug design.
